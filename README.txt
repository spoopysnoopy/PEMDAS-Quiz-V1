This is my first version of PEMDAS Quiz v1. If you don't know, PEMDAS is the order of operations for math.
P = Parentheses
E = Exponents
M = Multiplication
D = Division
A = Addition
S = Subtraction
------------------------------
This is my first coding/building project so do't judge too much
------------------------------
There are only 3 questions that all have PEMDAS in them

Enjoy!
